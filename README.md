## About Me
My name is Stephen Reed and I have been working in the tech industry for the past ten years. I have spent time as a Product Manager, Project Manager, and Operations Specialist. The MIT Full Stack Engineering courses have been a challenge, but I feel as though I have a much better understanding of how web pages are built and manipulated using JS. Outside of class, I love to eat bread and ride by bike.
